# From /usr/share/doc/unbound/examples/unbound.conf:
# control which clients are allowed to make (recursive) queries
# to this server. Specify classless netblocks with /size and action.
# By default everything is refused, except for localhost.
# Choose deny (drop message), refuse (polite error reply),
# allow (recursive ok), allow_setrd (recursive ok, rd bit is forced on),
# allow_snoop (recursive and nonrecursive ok)
# deny_non_local (drop queries unless can be answered from local-data)
# refuse_non_local (like deny_non_local but polite error reply).
